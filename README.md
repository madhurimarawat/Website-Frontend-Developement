 # HTML <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/html5/html5-original.svg" title="HTML" alt="HTML" width="40" height="40">
--> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.<br><br>
--> It is used to design the web pages. With the help of HTML, you can create a complete website structure.<br><br>
--> HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.<br><br>
--> Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages.<br>
#  HTML Basic Tags <img src="https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/112-1127775_transparent-vector-clipart-software-transparent-code-icon-png.png" width="40" height="40">
<ul>
<li>DOCTYPE! html â€“ A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.</li>

<li> html â€“ This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.</li>

<li>headâ€“ This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.</li>

<li> bodyâ€“ The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.</li>
  </ul>

# CSS <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/css3/css3-plain-wordmark.svg"  title="CSS" alt="CSS" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
--> Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.<br><br>
--> CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages.<br><br>
--> More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.<br><br>
--> It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more.<br><br>
--> CSS lets developers and designers define how website behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.<br><br>

# JavaScript <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" title="JavaScript" alt="JavaScript" width="40" height="40"/>

--> JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions.<br><br> 
--> While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.<br><br>
--> JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.<br>

# Bootstrap <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/bootstrap/bootstrap-plain-wordmark.svg"  title="Bootstrap" alt="Bootstrap" width="40" height="40"/>

--> Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.<br><br>
--> It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.<br><br>
--> The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project.<br><br>
--> Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries like jQuery.<br><br>
--> They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation drop-downs, and carousels.<br><br>
--> Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code.<br>
